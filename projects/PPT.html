<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>StrathSEDS is working on an electric space propulsion project by designing, building and testing a propulsion unit known as a Pulsed Plasma Thruster (PPT). Due to the high propellant efficiencies achieved, electrical propulsion units are a large area of research in aerospace and represent a major advance over traditional chemical rocket propulsion when used in the vacuum of space. PPTs are the simplest form of electric propulsion and may find uses in many satellites, particularly CubeSats, for many purposes including station-keeping and de-orbiting. While PPTs benefit from mechanical and electrical simplicity and robustness, they are one of the least efficient forms of electric propulsion, with propellant efficiencies around just 10%.</p>

<h2>General Principles</h2>

<p>Electrical propulsion units generate thrust by accelerating charged particles in an electric or magnetic field to high velocity, and then exhausting this material. Since the thrust generated is equal to the rate of change of momentum of the fuel, this high velocity (of the order of tens of km/s) means that only a small mass flow rate is needed to generate thrust. As such, propellant mass is reduced which leads to reduced launch mass and, therefore, reduced launch costs. While electrical propulsion uses a small amount of fuel (about a tenth of the mass of chemical propulsion fuel required for the same acceleration), it only generates a very low level of thrust. Because of this, electrical propulsion units need to operate for extended periods of time to provide a meaningful increase in spacecraft velocity.</p>

<p>A Pulsed Plasma Thruster operates by generating plasma from the stored fuel and using that plasma to pass between two electrically charged plates. Since plasma is made up of charged particles, this effectively completes the circuit between the plates allowing electricity to discharge through the plasma. This flow of electrons (the electrical discharge) induces a strong magnetic field through the principle of electromagnetic induction. The resultant magnetic field generates a powerful Lorentz force on the plasma, accelerating it out of the exhaust at high speed.</p>

<p>PPT fuels tend to be solid state and are most commonly fuelled by PTFE (more usually known as Teflon). Solid fuels make optimum use of the limited space on board satellites and increase storage simplicity but some research PPTs do make use of liquid or gaseous fuels. These types of fuel, however, are very much in the minority. In a typical Pulsed Plasma Thruster, the solid fuel is ablated and sublimated by an electrical arc generated by a spark plug. The temperatures generated in this arc provide enough energy to the resulting gas to generate plasma which is propelled by the force of the ablation. This plasma then passes between the charged plates, where the mechanism discussed above results in the Lorentz force used to accelerate the plasma.</p>

<h2>StrathSEDS Design</h2>

<p>The Pulsed Plasma Thruster being built by StrathSEDS is a test PPT designed to compare how different internal geometries and components affect the efficiency of the PPT. As such, our design is not intended for use on a real spacecraft, but the lessons learned may provide the opportunity in the future. The internal geometry is controlled by changing the orientation and separation of the charged plates within the PPT. To achieve this controllability, the design incorporates fully adjustable plate clamps which allow the distance between the plates to be changed to find the optimum voltage/plate separation combination for maximum efficiency. This plate clamp layout also allows the plates to be angled, allowing testing to determine if angling the plates together could increase propellant efficiency by concentrating the magnetic field as the voltage drops, and/or by creating a nozzle effect.</p>

<p>Another feature of the StrathSEDS design is the outside structure of the PPT. The design of the structure allows for nozzle or diffuser designs to be added later in testing, allowing identification of any efficiency improvements from different exhaust designs.</p>

<p>The plates in the StrathSEDS design are arranged vertically, allowing glass plates above and below the plates to be used to observe the PPT in use in the vacuum chamber. Being able to view the PPT in operation may provide an opportunity to find design improvements to increase the efficiency of PPTs by providing a clearer understanding of the processes at work during PPT operation.</p>
