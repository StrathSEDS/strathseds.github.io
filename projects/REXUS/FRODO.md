excerpt: Foldable Reflective system for Omnidirectional De-Orbiting
author: StrathSat-R Team

FRODO is a technology demonstrator for a passive de-orbiting system for CubeSats. It shall demonstrate a potential method for deploying a large reflective sail using residual air inflation. This is the inflation resulting from the expansion of small pockets of air in the absence of external pressure (ie. the vacuum of space)

Below the inflated frame can be seen to support a reflective panel.

Below is an image of the first prototype of FRODO, with a larger flight model to be created for the mission.

Part of the challenge for FRODO is the packaging requirements, where it has to fit in a 4 x 10 x 10 cm storage container before deployment.
