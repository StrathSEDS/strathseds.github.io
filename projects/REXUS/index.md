StrathSEDS presents [SAM][sa] & [FRODO][fr] leaving the [SHIRE][sh], a mission set to launch in March 2013 on the ESA/DLR/SNSB REXUS sounding rocket.

The team has been selected as one of a handful of European university student teams for the [ESA/DLR/SNSB REXUS programme][1].

Project involves deploying two CubeSat like structures from a rocket at 90km altitude and using them to test deployable space structures, the different sections of the experiment are detailed below.

The background behind the FRODO part of the experiment is the first stage of the [StrathSat project][2] aiming to develop and test a CubeSat de-orbiting device.

The StrathSat-R team comes from across departments at the University of Strathclyde with postgraduate and undergraduate students working together to complete this exciting project.
