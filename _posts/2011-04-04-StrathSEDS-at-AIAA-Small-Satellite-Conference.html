<p>Charlotte L&uuml;cking will present her work on a passive de-orbiting strategy for high altitude CubeSat missions using a deployable reflective balloon as part of a student scholorship competition at the 25th Annual AIAA/USU Conference on Small Satellites</p>

<p>An explanation of the orbital dynamics of the method and an analysis of its efficiency can be found in the following paper: L&uuml;cking, Charlotte and Colombo, Camilla and Mcinnes, Colin (2011) <a href="http://strathprints.strath.ac.uk/41233/">A passive de-orbiting strategy for high altitude CubeSat missions using a deployable reflective balloon</a>. In: 8th IAA Symposium on Small Satellites, 2011-04-04 - 2011-04-08, Berlin.
