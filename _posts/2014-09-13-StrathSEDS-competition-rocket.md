excerpt: StrathSEDS successfully launched our rocket for the National Rocketry Championship.

On 13.09.14 StrathSEDS successfully launched our rocket for the National Rocketry Championship.  The target altitude was 1000m, our rocket JUST TESTING reached 986m in a time of 14.75.  The parachute deployed successfully and the rocket was recovered without sustaining any damage.  The novel ejection system functioned successfully as the parachute was thrown cleanly from the rocket and reduced it to an acceptable landing speed which was around -10m/s.  The radio link functioned throughout the entire flight, transmitting the rockets flight time, altitude, velocity and acceleration as well as sending a signal to show the servo had armed and then later deployed the parachute.  

StrathSEDS would firstly like to thank UKSEDS for running the National Rocketry Championship and their rocketry workshop.  It has been a great first experience into the world of rocketry for all of our team who thoroughly enjoyed it.  Thanks also to Teal Engineering who provided many of the tools necessary to build our rocket.  

We would also like to thank all of those at the Scottish Aeronautics and Rocketry Association, as well as the organisers of the IRW for allowing us to launch at their events and providing us with many useful tips and tricks (never again will the strength of masking tape be underestimated in favour of duck tape).  Our thanks also go to Colin MacLaren, Mitchell Hamilton and Gillian McNeil for allowing us to use their pictures in our report.  Special thanks go to John Bonsor, our team mentor, who has helped us a great deal and put a lot of time into coming to the University to talk to us; the advice he has given to us has been invaluable.  

Our report from the launch has been submitted to UKSEDS and we are waiting to find out how we did.
