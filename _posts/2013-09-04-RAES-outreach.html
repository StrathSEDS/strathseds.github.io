<p>StrathSEDS took part in the Royal Aeronautical Society's (RAeS) Cool Aeronautics outreach event at Prestwick International Airport on the 3rd of September.</p>

<p>Five local primary schools in Ayrshire participated, with pupils from primary 5 and 6 classes.  
Members of StrathSEDS ran two workshops during the day, covering topics such as distances of objects from the earth, inflatable structures, SrathSEDS' rocket-borne experiment StrathSat-R, and a space survival challenge where pupils had to decide what equipment and personnel would be necessary on a mission to settle on an exoplanet.</p>

<p>We would like to thank the RAeS Prestwick Branch for organising the event, and for giving StrathSEDS the opportunity to be involved in the Cool Aeronautics programme.</p>
