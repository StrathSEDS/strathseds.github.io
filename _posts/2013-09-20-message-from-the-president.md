To all of those that signed up during the fair, I say welcome, and to those of you returning, may I say welcome back.

The Freshers fair was a great event with a healthy turnout that lead to some new faces signing up, and some more familiar ones stopping by to see what we have planned for the year. 

This year the fair was held in [Strathclyde Unions][su-union-site] Barony Bar, with stall from all kinds of societies ranging from the academic likes of the [Physics Society][phy-soc-site], the very social [Geek soc][gs-site], the more location based societies like the [Hong Kong Society][hk-soc-site] and [French Soc][fr-soc-twitter].

This event was a good chance to let people within the university know what we do, and that there is in fact a society for people who are enthusiastic about space.

There was a good number of new signups, and hopefully we will see them all on Tuesday night at 5pm for our first meeting of the year on level 4 of the Livingstone Tower.

Mark Stewart
