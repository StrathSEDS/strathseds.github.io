excerpt: StrathSEDS launches first rocket
---

On the 23rd of November Ben Turner braved the mild wind and slightly cold conditions at the Fairlie Moore rocket site to launch the first rocket to be constructed by StrathSEDS.  The launch was run by the Scottish Auronautics and Rocketry Association (SARA) who were kind enough to let us take part in their last launch of the season.  

The rocket dubbed THOR seen below soared to an altitude of around 200m at which point gravity reared its ugly head and THOR began plummeting majestically towards the ground with no sign of a parachute.  Eventually the parachute decided it was time to make a dramatic appearance around 10m from the ground, giving it just enough time to accomplish nothing. However rocket and parachute were both recovered successfully (bar some minor scratches and damage to the paint) and will hopefully be launched in the near future along with several other rockets now under construction.

We would like to thank all those from the SARA who allowed us to launch at their site and gave us a great deal of useful advice and a great first experience at launching rockets.
