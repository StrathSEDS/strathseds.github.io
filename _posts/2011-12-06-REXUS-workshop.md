StrathSat-R Success in REXUS Programme

The StrathSat-R team has been invited to ESTEC, Amsterdam, to present their project proposal for the REXUS programme. If successful the team will send their two CubeSats up to the edge of space at an altitude of 100km, at which point they will deploy their inflatable structure payloads.

This is an exciting project with a large team already in place, but if any students are interested in getting involved contact us at strathseds@hotmail.com .
